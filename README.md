# What is this?

This is just a simple slideshow experiment using openFrameworks.

In particular, I want to be able to use animated gifs with transparency.

Since it's not possible (as far as I know) to preserve transparency when playing gifs as a videoPlayer object, I'm loading in the gifs as sprite sheets and then masking to reveal each frame of the gif.
